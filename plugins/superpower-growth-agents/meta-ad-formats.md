## Static Image Formats

### Single Image Ad
**Best For**: Direct response, simple value prop, testimonials

| Placement | Ratio | Resolution | File Size |
|-----------|-------|------------|-----------|
| Feed | 1:1 | 1080 x 1080 | < 30MB |
| Feed | 4:5 | 1080 x 1350 | < 30MB |
| Stories/Reels | 9:16 | 1080 x 1920 | < 30MB |
| Right Column | 1.91:1 | 1200 x 628 | < 30MB |

**Text Limits**:
- Primary text: 125 characters (recommended), 500 max
- Headline: 27 characters (recommended), 40 max

### Carousel Ad
**Best For**: Multiple benefits, product features, storytelling, before/after

| Placement | Ratio | Resolution | Cards |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------|
| Feed | 1:1 | 1080 x 1080 | 2-10 cards |
| Stories | 9:16 | 1080 x 1920 | 2-10 cards |

**Structure Options**:
1. **Problem → Solution Flow**: Card 1 = pain point, Cards 2-4 = benefits, Card 5 = CTA
2. **Feature Breakdown**: Each card = one benefit/feature
3. **Social Proof Series**: Each card = testimonial or result
4. **Educational**: Step-by-step or "X things you didn't know"

**Best Practices**:
- First card must hook - it's the only one visible in feed
- Consistent visual style across cards
- Each card should work standalone (for Stories)
- End with strong CTA card

## Video Formats

### In-Feed Video
**Best For**: Demonstrations, testimonials, storytelling, UGC-style

| Placement | Ratio | Resolution | Length |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|
| Feed | 1:1 or 4:5 | 1080 x 1080/1350 | 15-60 sec |
| Stories/Reels | 9:16 | 1080 x 1920 | 15-30 sec |

**Structure (15-30 sec)**:
- 0-3 sec: Hook (pattern interrupt)
- 3-10 sec: Problem/Agitate
- 10-20 sec: Solution/Benefits
- 20-30 sec: CTA + social proof

**Best Practices**:
- Assume sound off - use captions
- Hook in first 3 seconds or lose them
- Mobile-first framing (close-ups work better)
- UGC-style often outperforms polished production
