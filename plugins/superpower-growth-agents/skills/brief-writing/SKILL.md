## Copy Writing Rules

### Headlines (3-8 words)

Lead with outcome or pain point:
- ✅ "Your body isn't lying"
- ✅ "What your doctor missed"
- ❌ "Comprehensive biomarker testing" (feature, not outcome)

Write 3+ variations minimum:
- H1.0: Strongest, most direct
- H1.1: Different angle/emotion
- H1.2: Question format or alternative

### Hook (5-10 words)

Stop the scroll:
- Pattern interrupt
- Unexpected statement
- Relatable pain

Examples:
- "Your doctor says fine. Your body disagrees."
- "33 and exhausted? You're not alone."
- "The test that changes everything."

### Body Copy (10-15 words per sentence)

**Not ultra-short staccato:**
❌ "Tired. Confused. Dismissed. Sound familiar?"

**Conversational but substantive:**
✅ "You know something's off. Your doctor says you're fine. 100+ biomarkers tell the real story."

**Use their words** from Reddit research:
- "finally someone who believes me" → "Finally, answers that validate what you've known all along"
- "my doctor rolled his eyes" → "No more being dismissed"

### Benefits (3-4 with ✅)

Group together, no blank lines between:

✅ 100+ biomarkers in one blood draw
✅ 24/7 access to clinical team
✅ Personalized protocols that actually work
✅ $199/year (most states)

### CTA

Action verb + implied low commitment:
- "Get your answers"
- "See what's really happening"
- "Start at superpower.com"

## Visual Direction Guidelines

### Be Specific, Not Vague

**Vague (unhelpful):**
- "Something healthy"
- "Woman looking happy"
- "Clean design"

**Specific (actionable):**
- "Woman, mid-30s, looking at phone with expression of relief/recognition"
- "Split-screen: exhausted morning (left) vs. energized morning (right)"
- "Data visualization showing hormone levels with one highlighted in amber"

### Mood/Tone Options

Match to desire:
- **Power/Independence:** Confident, empowered, in-control
- **Curiosity:** Intrigued, discovering, engaged
- **Acceptance:** Relieved, validated, understood
- **Tranquility:** Calm, peaceful, certain

### DO/DON'T Examples

**DO:**
- Show real moments (scrolling phone at 2am, talking to doctor)
- Use warm, approachable lighting
- Include subtle data elements
- Show diverse 30+ women

**DON'T:**
- Generic stock photo smiles
- Clinical/medical aesthetics
- Before/after that implies disease → cure
- Unattainable perfection

## Format Recommendations

### Single Image
**Best for:** Simple, direct messages
**When:** One clear point, Problem Aware stage
**Ratios:** 1:1 (feed), 4:5 (feed), 9:16 (stories)

### Carousel
**Best for:** Story progression, multiple benefits, education
**When:** Solution Aware, complex mechanism explanation
**Slides:** 4-7 optimal
**Ratios:** 1:1 (feed)

### UGC-Style
**Best for:** Testimonial, validation, social proof
**When:** Problem Aware (empathy), Product Aware (proof)
**Format:** Talking head or text-on-screen
**Ratios:** 9:16 (Reels/Stories), 4:5 (Feed)
