# Meta Ad Copywriting

Write conversion-optimized, compliant ad copy for Meta platforms.

## Core Principles

### 1. Lead with Outcomes, Not Features

**Feature-focused (wrong):**
❌ "100+ biomarkers tested"
❌ "Comprehensive blood panel"
❌ "24/7 clinical team access"

**Outcome-focused (right):**
✅ "Know exactly why you're exhausted"
✅ "Stop wondering. Start knowing."
✅ "Answers when you need them, not in 6 weeks"

### 2. Use Their Language

Pull directly from Reddit research:
- "finally someone believes me" → "Finally, validation"
- "my doctor rolled his eyes" → "No more being dismissed"
- "am I crazy?" → "You're not crazy. Your body is telling you something."

### 3. Channel Existing Desire

Don't create new desire—channel what exists:
- They already want answers → Show how you provide them
- They already feel dismissed → Show how you validate them
- They already feel overwhelmed → Show how you simplify

## Copy Structure by Awareness Stage

### Problem Aware Copy

**Structure:** Pain → Empathy → Mechanism → Benefits → Proof → CTA

```
[Hook with pain point]

[Empathy - show you understand]

[Mechanism introduction]

✅ [Benefit 1]
✅ [Benefit 2]
✅ [Benefit 3]

[Proof element]

[CTA]
```

**Example:**
```
Exhausted at 34?

Your doctor says you're fine. Your body says otherwise.

Annual physicals test 20-30 markers. We test 100+.

✅ Hormone levels your doctor never checks
✅ Inflammation markers that explain the brain fog
✅ Nutrient deficiencies behind the crashes

150,000+ members finally have answers.

### Solution Aware Copy

**Structure:** Mechanism comparison → Why others fail → Our advantage → Benefits → CTA

```
[Competitive hook]

[Why typical solutions fail]

[Your mechanism advantage]

✅ [Specific advantage 1]
✅ [Specific advantage 2]
✅ [Specific advantage 3]

[CTA]
```

**Example:**
```
Annual physicals test 20-30 biomarkers.

That leaves hormones, inflammation, and nutrient deficiencies completely invisible.

We test 100+ biomarkers in one blood draw.

✅ Thyroid panel your doctor doesn't order
✅ Hormone markers that explain everything
✅ 24/7 clinical team to interpret results

### Product Aware Copy

**Structure:** Direct offer → Proof → Risk reversal → Urgency → CTA

```
[Direct value proposition]

[Social proof]

[Risk reversal / low commitment]

[Urgency if authentic]

[CTA]
```

**Example:**
```
$199/year. 100+ biomarkers. 24/7 clinical team.

150,000+ members. 10,000 five-star reviews.

One blood draw. Results in days.

Your body is changing right now.

## Formatting Rules (Non-Negotiable)

### Sentence Length

| Element | Word Limit |
|---------|-----------|
| Headlines | 3-8 words |
| Hook | 5-10 words |
| Body sentences | 10-15 words MAX |
| Benefits with ✅ | Up to 12 words |

### Spacing

**Between sentences:** BLANK LINE (creates visual breathing room)

**Between ✅ benefits:** NO blank lines (keeps them grouped)

**Example:**
```
Your doctor says fine.

Your body disagrees.

100+ biomarkers reveal what annual physicals miss.

✅ Complete hormone panel
✅ Inflammation markers
✅ Nutrient deficiencies

```

### ✅ Emoji Usage

- Use for 3-4 core benefits ONLY
- Group together without blank lines between
- Place after mechanism introduction, before CTA
- Each benefit should be concrete, not vague

**Good:**
```
✅ 100+ biomarkers in one draw
✅ 24/7 access to clinical team
✅ Personalized protocols
```

**Bad:**
```
✅ Better health (vague)
✅ Feel great (vague)
✅ Peace of mind (overused)
```

## Tone & Style

### Empowering, Not Scary

**Scary (avoid):**
❌ "You could be dying and not know it"
❌ "Silent killers hiding in your blood"

**Empowering (use):**
✅ "Catch it before it's serious"
✅ "Know what's happening inside"

### Confident Expert, Not Pushy Marketer

**Pushy:**
❌ "ACT NOW before it's too late!!!"
❌ "You NEED this test!"

**Confident:**
✅ "Your body is changing. Get the data."
✅ "The choice is simple."

### Conversational, Not Clinical

**Clinical:**
❌ "Comprehensive metabolic panel analysis"

**Conversational:**
✅ "See what's really going on with your metabolism"

## Compliance Integration

Reference `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/compliance-guide.md` for full rules. Key reminders:

**Approved:**
- "Detect early signs"
- "24/7 access to Superpower's clinical team"
- "Track biomarkers"
- "Personalized health recommendations"

**Prohibited:**
- "Prevent disease" / "Cure" / "Diagnose"
- "Year-round support" (use "24/7")
- "Replace your doctor"
- Guaranteed health outcomes

**Clinical Team Language:**
✅ "24/7 access to Superpower's clinical team"
✅ "Protocols co-created with Harvard, UCLA & Stanford MDs"
❌ "24/7 access to Harvard doctors" (wrong)
