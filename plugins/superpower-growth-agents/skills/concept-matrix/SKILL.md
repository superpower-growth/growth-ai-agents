description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "create a concept matrix", "generate ad concepts", "build creative variations", "systematic concept development", "Andromeda-ready concepts", or needs to produce high-volume creative concepts from insights. Provides methodology for generating 20-50+ concepts per campaign.

# Concept Matrix Development

Generate systematic, high-volume creative concepts optimized for Meta's Andromeda algorithm.

## Why Concept Matrices?

**Andromeda changed the game:**
- Old: 3-5 ads, precise targeting, single-variable testing
- New: 20-50 ads, broad targeting, creative diversity wins

A concept matrix ensures you generate variety systematically, not randomly.

## What Is a Concept?

```
Insight + Desire + Angle + Format = Concept
```

**Example:**
- **Insight:** Women feel dismissed by doctors
- **Desire:** Acceptance/Validation
- **Angle:** "Your body isn't lying"
- **Format:** Testimonial-style
- **Concept:** "Your doctor says fine. Your body says otherwise. 100+ biomarkers don't lie."

## The Matrix Method

### Axis 1: Insights (3-5)

From insight-generation phase:
1. Dismissed by healthcare system
2. Unexplained early symptoms
3. Information overwhelm
4. Loss of control over body
5. Validation seeking

### Axis 2: Desires (4-6)

From Steven Reiss framework:
- **Power** - Control, agency
- **Independence** - Self-reliance
- **Curiosity** - Knowledge, answers
- **Acceptance** - Validation
- **Order** - System, clarity
- **Tranquility** - Peace of mind

### Axis 3: Angles (4-5)

Messaging approaches:
- **Validation-first** - "You're not crazy"
- **Data empowerment** - "Know your numbers"
- **Comparison** - "vs. your annual physical"
- **Urgency** - "Before symptoms appear"
- **Community** - "Join 150K+ members"

### Axis 4: Formats (3-4)

Creative execution:
- **Single image** - Hero statement
- **Carousel** - Story progression
- **UGC-style** - Testimonial
- **Data visual** - Chart/graph

### Axis 5: Awareness Stage (3)

- **Problem Aware** - Lead with pain
- **Solution Aware** - Lead with mechanism
- **Product Aware** - Lead with proof/offer

## Building the Matrix

### Step 1: Create the Grid

```
| # | Insight | Desire | Angle | Format | Stage | Concept |
|---|---------|--------|-------|--------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Dismissed | Acceptance | Validation | Testimonial | Problem | [Concept] |
| 2 | Dismissed | Power | Data | Single image | Problem | [Concept] |
| 3 | Early symptoms | Curiosity | Data | Carousel | Problem | [Concept] |
...
```

### Step 2: Generate Combinations

Don't generate ALL combinations (that's 3×6×5×4×3 = 1,080). Select strategically:

**Primary combinations (highest priority):**
- Strongest insight × Most relevant desire × Best-fit format

**Variation combinations:**
- Same insight, different desire
- Same desire, different angle
- Same angle, different format

**Target: 30-50 concepts per campaign**

### Step 3: Write Concept Statements

Each concept needs a 1-2 sentence summary:

```
CONCEPT #12: "The Validation Seeker"

Insight: Women dismissed by doctors
Desire: Acceptance
Angle: Validation-first
Format: UGC testimonial
Stage: Problem Aware

Statement: "Your doctor says you're fine. Your body disagrees. 100+ biomarkers reveal what annual physicals miss."

Hook direction: Lead with the dismissal pain
Visual: Woman looking at phone with relieved expression
```

## Output Format

```markdown
# Concept Matrix: [Campaign Name]

## Matrix Parameters

**Insights Used:**
1. [Insight 1]
2. [Insight 2]
3. [Insight 3]

**Desires Targeted:**
- [Desire 1] - Primary for concepts #X, Y, Z
- [Desire 2] - Primary for concepts #A, B, C

**Formats:**
- Single image: X concepts
- Carousel: Y concepts
- UGC-style: Z concepts

## Full Matrix (30 Concepts)

### Problem Aware Concepts (15)

| # | Insight | Desire | Angle | Format | Concept Statement |
|---|---------|--------|-------|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | Dismissed | Acceptance | Validation | UGC | "Finally, someone who believes me" |
| 2 | Dismissed | Power | Data | Single | "Your body has the answers. Now get them." |
| 3 | Early symptoms | Curiosity | Discovery | Carousel | "What your doctor missed (and why)" |
...

### Solution Aware Concepts (10)

| # | Insight | Desire | Angle | Format | Concept Statement |
|---|---------|--------|-------|--------|-------------------|
| 16 | Overwhelm | Order | System | Carousel | "100+ biomarkers. One clear plan." |
...

### Product Aware Concepts (5)

| # | Insight | Desire | Angle | Format | Concept Statement |
|---|---------|--------|-------|--------|-------------------|
| 26 | Control | Power | Comparison | Single | "$199 vs. $10K concierge. Same answers." |
...

## Priority Ranking

**Tier 1 (Brief immediately):**
1. Concept #X - [Rationale]
2. Concept #Y - [Rationale]
3. Concept #Z - [Rationale]

**Tier 2 (Brief next):**
4-10. [Concepts with rationale]

**Tier 3 (Holdback):**
11-30. [Reserve for testing expansion]

---

## Testing Strategy

**Initial Launch Set (10 concepts):**
- 3 Problem Aware (varying desires)
- 4 Solution Aware (varying angles)
- 3 Product Aware (varying formats)

**Scaling Pattern:**
- Winners → Add variations (same insight, different angle)
- Losers → Replace with different insight
```

## Concept Diversity Rules

Ensure matrix covers:

**Desire diversity:**
- [ ] At least 4 different primary desires represented
- [ ] No single desire in more than 40% of concepts

**Format diversity:**
- [ ] At least 3 formats represented
- [ ] UGC-style concepts included

**Awareness diversity:**
- [ ] 40-50% Problem Aware
- [ ] 30-40% Solution Aware
- [ ] 15-20% Product Aware

**Emotional tone diversity:**
- [ ] Validation/empathy angles
- [ ] Empowerment/control angles
- [ ] Urgency/FOMO angles
- [ ] Aspiration/possibility angles

## Quick-Start Templates

### 5-Insight × 4-Desire Quick Matrix

```
| | Power | Independence | Curiosity | Acceptance |
|---|-------|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Dismissed | #1 | #2 | #3 | #4 |
| Early symptoms | #5 | #6 | #7 | #8 |
| Overwhelm | #9 | #10 | #11 | #12 |
| Control loss | #13 | #14 | #15 | #16 |
| Validation | #17 | #18 | #19 | #20 |
```

= 20 base concepts. Add format variations for 30-50 total.

### Format Expansion Rule

Each strong concept gets 2-3 format variations:
- Base concept as single image
- Story version as carousel
- Social proof version as UGC

20 base concepts × 1.5 format variations = 30 total concepts
