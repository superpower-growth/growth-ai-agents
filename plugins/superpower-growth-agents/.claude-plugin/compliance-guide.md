# 🧬 LegitScript Peptide Content Compliance Guide

**Goal:** Ensure all peptide- and compounding-related content on Superpower.com complies with LegitScript, FDA, and FTC standards while maintaining SEO performance and educational value

**🚨 FUNDAMENTAL RULE: NEVER MANUFACTURE DATA**
- **NEVER create fake statistics, percentages, or numbers**
- **NEVER invent study results or research findings**
- **NEVER guess data points or outcomes**
- All statistics must be verifiable from credible sources
- When unable to verify → use qualitative language instead
- Better to say "studies show" than make up "73% of users"

---

## ⚠️ Core Principles

- Educational first. Clear "not medical advice." No disease diagnosis or cure claims.
- No claims of **equivalence**, **sameness**, or **superiority** to FDA-approved drugs.
- For **compounded drugs (503A)**: disclose **not FDA-approved**, patient-specific Rx only, no office stock, and no promotion as copies of FDA-approved products
- All health claims must be **truthful, non-misleading**, and **substantiated** with primary sources.
- They should **never imply** that Superpower sells, prescribes, or endorses unapproved compounds.

---

## ❌ Do Not

- Call any **unapproved or compounded** product "safe," "effective," "clinically proven," "same as Ozempic/Wegovy," or "better than GLP-1s."
- Do not refer to Ozempic/Wegovy in ads that promote compounded GLP-1s
- Refer to any **unapproved peptide** as *"safe," "effective," "clinically proven,"* or *"used by Superpower."*
- Imply Superpower sells **research-only** peptides or Category 2/3 bulk substances.
- Compare **experimental or trial compounds** to approved drugs (e.g., *"better than Ozempic"* or *"similar to semaglutide"*).
- Include **anecdotal or personal-use language** (e.g., *"our team uses it," "patients have seen results," "real-world use"*).
- Use testimonials, before/after photos, or anecdotes to imply outcomes.
- Make **disease treatment** or **weight-loss** promises; avoid "treats," "heals," "reverses," "cures."
- Mention **compounding legality** unless directly citing official FDA language.
- Avoid **language implying endorsement or access**
- Compare **experimental compounds** to approved drugs.
- Mention "FDA registered" in a way that implies **approval** or **endorsement**.

---

## ✅ Do

- Reference **FDA or regulatory statements** directly and link to official sources.
- For 503A products, state: **not FDA-approved**, dispensed **only** pursuant to a **patient-specific prescription**, compounded from compliant **Category 1** bulk substances when applicable, and **not** promoted as a copy of a commercially available drug.
- Include a link to the **official clinicaltrials.gov** page for ongoing studies.
- Maintain a **"Research Only / Not For Sale"** banner or line near the top of each page.
- Use neutral, mechanistic phrasing: "has been **investigated**," "is **studied** for," "evidence is **preliminary**."
- Clearly state that Superpower **does not offer or sell** these substances.
- Cite FDA, NIH, PubMed, [ClinicalTrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov/) when discussing regulation or evidence.
- Replace "boosts, improves, heals" with "investigated for," "being studied for," "shows potential in preclinical models"
- Include lab test caveats (IVD vs LDT) and derived-index disclaimers where biomarker pages appear alongside peptides.

## 📝 SEO-Safe Writing Guidelines

We can retain SEO performance while staying compliant by reframing tone and structure.

| Type | Instead of… | Say… |
|------|-------------|------|
| Promotional | "Used to heal gut lining" | "Studied for its potential effects on gastrointestinal tissue in preclinical models." |
| Efficacy Claim | "Boosts growth hormone" | "Has been investigated for its influence on growth hormone pathways." |
| Comparison | "More potent than GLP-1s" | "Currently being studied in the context of metabolic regulation." |
| Availability | "Available through Superpower" | "Available **only when clinically appropriate** via patient-specific prescription. Not FDA-approved" |

## ⚠️ Add Disclaimers to top and bottom

> ⚠️ *Disclaimer: Educational content. Not medical advice. These peptides are not approved by the FDA for general use, and Superpower does not offer or sell these substances. Any discussion of effects or mechanisms reflects preliminary research and should not be interpreted as medical advice.*

## 📝 Include Status Section

Add **"Status" section** for each peptide:
> Regulatory Status: Not approved for human use
> Research Stage: Preclinical / Clinical Trial Phase 2
> Availability: Not available via Superpower

## 🧪 Biomarker/Lab Tie-ins (when peptide pages mention labs)

- For **IVD** assays: "Measured by FDA-cleared clinical laboratory methods; used to aid clinician evaluation; not a stand-alone diagnosis."
- For **LDTs** (LC/MS, NMR, ICP-MS): "Laboratory-developed test validated under CLIA; **not** cleared or approved by FDA."
- For **derived ratios/scores**: "Derived from FDA-cleared results; the index itself is **not** FDA-cleared."

## 🧩 Compounded Products Module (applies to any peptide/drug we actually offer)

- **Not FDA-approved**. Prepared by a licensed 503A pharmacy for an **individual patient** based on a **patient-specific prescription**.
- **No office stock** or general resale.
- **No promotion** as "copies" of commercially available drugs except where the prescriber documents clinical need consistent with law.
- When sourced from **bulk drug substances**, they are Category 1 (or otherwise permitted) and from **qualified suppliers**; not Category 2 or 3.
- **No equivalence** or sameness claims to any FDA-approved reference product.
- Quality, stability, and **beyond-use dating** are per USP <795>/<797>/<800> and pharmacy SOPs; not FDA labeling.
- Adverse events and problems should be reported to the pharmacy and FDA MedWatch.

### GLP-1 Specific Add On

Compounded GLP-1 products (e.g., semaglutide/tirzepatide) are **not FDA-approved**. We do not claim equivalence to branded GLP-1s. Dispensing occurs only with a patient-specific prescription when clinically appropriate. We do **not** use or endorse non-equivalent salt forms. Dosing, counseling, and monitoring are determined by the clinician.

## 🧠 AI Disclosures (sitewide and chat)

- Conspicuous **AI** label. **Not medical advice**.
- Route red-flag content and abnormal results to human clinicians per SOP.
- Track state transparency notice requirements in California, Illinois, Maine, Nevada, Texas; keep logs of disclosures and escalation outcomes.

## 🧾 Substantiation & Citations

- Every mechanistic or risk-association statement gets a **primary** citation (PubMed/NIH/FDA/peer-reviewed).
- No reliance on blogs, vendor whitepapers, or testimonials.
- Comparative claims require head-to-head data; otherwise avoid.

## 🔎 Copy Guardrails for Growth

- No superlatives: replace "strongest predictor," "earliest detection" with "associated with risk," "may aid assessment."
- No pricing claims like "cheapest," "guaranteed savings." If mentioning cost, qualify and date the context.
- No "risk-free" or "side-effect free."
- CTAs: "Talk to a clinician," "See if you're eligible," never "Buy now" for compounded products.

## 🧰 Content Template Blocks

### Research-only peptide (not offered)
> "[Name] is not FDA-approved for general use. It has been studied for [mechanism/target] in [preclinical/Phase X] research. Superpower does not offer this substance. Evidence is preliminary; no safety or effectiveness claims are made."

### Compounded 503A product (offered when appropriate)
> "[Name] is a 503A compounded medication that is not FDA-approved. It may be prescribed when clinically appropriate for an individual patient and dispensed pursuant to a patient-specific prescription. We do not claim equivalence to any FDA-approved drug. Counseling, monitoring, and eligibility are determined by the clinician."

### Mechanism paragraph
> "Early research indicates [mechanism]. These findings are preliminary and do not establish safety or effectiveness for any indication."
