## Tone of Voice

### Core Principles (Verified from Website)
- **Empowering, not scary**: Focus on taking control, not living in fear
  - Example: "Health is your greatest superpower. It's time to unlock it."
- **Data-driven but accessible**: Use specific numbers but explain why they matter
  - Example: "26% of members find early risk factors for diabetes"
- **Urgent but not pushy**: Create FOMO through value comparison, not fear tactics
  - Example: "What could cost you $15,000 is $199"
- **Professional but conversational**: Credible expertise like talking to a knowledgeable friend
  - Example: "You're not limited to just one. Your membership includes one comprehensive test each year, but if you'd like to track your progress more closely, you can add extra tests at any time."
- **Benefit-focused**: Always tie features to outcomes the audience cares about
  - Example: "Testing energy markers can uncover fatigue drivers like anemia or thyroid issues, helping you restore vitality before symptoms escalate."

### Actual Writing Style (Based on Website Analysis)

**Sentence Length Patterns:**
- **Headlines**: 3-8 words ("Get clarity at every step")
- **Subheads**: 5-10 words ("Test 100+ markers")
- **Body copy**: 12-20 words (main explanations)
- **Detailed explanations**: 15-30 words when needed
- **FAQs**: 25-45+ words (structured with bullets for readability)

**NOT Ultra-Short Staccato:**
The website does NOT use 5-8 word maximum sentences. Actual examples:
- "From heart health to hormone balance our comprehensive test panels detect early signs of over 1,000 conditions" (17 words)
- "Your membership includes one comprehensive blood draw each year, covering 100+ biomarkers in a single collection" (15 words)

**Actual Writing Formula:**
1. **Punchy headline** (3-8 words) to grab attention
2. **Medium explanatory sentence** (12-18 words) that adds context
3. **Bullet points or sub-sections** (8-15 words each) for details
4. **Generous white space** to make it scannable
5. **Direct CTA** (2-3 words: "Try Superpower", "Start testing")

**Rhythm:**
- NOT staccato punch-pause-punch
- INSTEAD: Clear explanatory flow with strategic brevity
- Think: **Confident expert who explains clearly**, not **rapid-fire marketer**

**Spacing & Structure:**
- Very generous use of white space
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences max)
- Bullets for scannability
- Visual hierarchy over word count limits

**Voice Character:**
- Modern doctor's office that respects your time
- Professional medical expertise meets conversational accessibility
- Data-driven specificity in everyday language
- Confident without being arrogant

## Eugene Schwartz Framework Reference

### 5 Stages of Awareness
1. **Unaware**: Doesn't know they have a problem (avoid - too expensive)
2. **Problem Aware**: Knows something feels "off" but doesn't know why
3. **Solution Aware**: Knows comprehensive testing exists, hasn't picked a provider
4. **Product Aware**: Knows about Superpower, hasn't decided to buy
5. **Most Aware**: Ready to buy, needs final nudge

### Copy Structure by Awareness Stage
- **Problem Aware**: Hook with pain → Show understanding → Introduce mechanism → Explain how mechanism solves pain → Proof → CTA
- **Solution Aware**: Competitive comparison → Why others fail → Our superior mechanism → Specific advantages → Proof → CTA
- **Product Aware**: Address objections → Reinforce mechanism → Pricing comparison → Risk reversal → Proof → CTA
- **Most Aware**: Urgency/scarcity → Quick mechanism reminder → Social proof → Strong CTA
